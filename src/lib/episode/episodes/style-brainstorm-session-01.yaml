# Style Brainstorm Session - Unbreakable Series
# UPDATED: Multi-modal style system with dynamic color shifts
#
# Key Insight from James:
# The style isn't one thing. It's a LIVING visual language that shifts
# based on perspective, mood, and narrative moment.
#
# Nick sees the world differently - he uses thermal filters on his camera.
# That's not a gimmick, that's characterization. The visual style should
# reflect whose eyes we're seeing through and what they're feeling.

# THE STYLE SYSTEM (not a single style - a system of modes)

style_system:
  name: "Living Canvas"
  philosophy: >
    The visual style is a character itself. It breathes, shifts, and responds
    to the narrative. Different perspectives get different visual treatments.
    The color palette is alive - it changes with mood, music energy, and
    whose eyes we're looking through. Part manga, part watercolor, part
    rotoscoping, part thermal vision, part pure realism. All of it true.

        Hybrid illustration style: manga-influenced composition with watercolor
        textures and semi-realistic character rendering. Medium ink outlines
        that breathe - thicker in emotional moments, thinner in gentle ones.
        Detailed backgrounds with environmental storytelling. Warm palette
        by default but shifts with mood.
      influences:
        - "manga (dynamic composition, speed lines for energy, panel-like framing)"
        - "watercolor (soft color bleeds, visible paper texture, wet edges)"
        - "rotoscoping (semi-realistic movement, traced-from-life quality)"
        - "editorial illustration (rich detail, magazine quality)"

        The world shifts to how Nick literally sees it. Thermal-vision
        colors (neon green, hot orange, electric blue, deep red). Like
        the thermal camera filter he uses on his phone. But not just
        thermal - sometimes it's oversaturated candy colors, sometimes
        infrared purple, sometimes everything glows. Nick sees warmth
        in everything. People glow with color. The world is electric.

        Thermal infrared vision style, neon green and hot orange and

        Color drains away progressively. Not black and white - more like

        Harsher lines. More angular manga influence. Shadows deeper.
        But always - ALWAYS - a thread of warm light somewhere. Because
        James never stopped fighting.
      prompt_fragment: >
        Desaturated illustration with deep shadows, angular manga-influenced
        composition, harsh ink lines, color drained from the world except
        for one bright green element (headphones), atmospheric fog,
        isolated figures, oppressive but with a single thread of warm
        golden light breaking through

    prompt: >
      Hybrid manga-watercolor illustration with semi-realistic character
      rendering. A father in his mid-30s with messy brown hair, stubble,
      blue hoodie walks with his 6-year-old son on an Irish country road.
      The boy has curly brown hair, freckles, oversized bright green
      headphones. Rolling green fields, old stone walls, grey-blue Irish
      sky with golden light breaking through clouds. Ink outlines that vary
      in weight, soft watercolor color bleeds at edges, paper texture
      visible. Dynamic manga-influenced low-angle composition. Rich
      environmental detail - wildflowers, distant sheep, puddles reflecting
      sky. Warm earth tones with green and blue accents. Emotionally warm,
      intimate. The boy is pointing at something with excitement.
    negative: "photorealistic, 3D render, anime eyes, flat colors, simple background, dark, gloomy, ugly"

  - id: "test-nicks-vision"
    mode: "nicks_vision"
    prompt: >
      Thermal infrared camera vision of a father and young son walking on
      a country road. Neon green background, bodies glowing hot orange and
      deep red, cool blue clothing, electric yellow highlights where skin
      is warmest. Psychedelic heat-map color palette. The father and son
      are brightest - they radiate warmth. The road is cool blue-green.
      Trees are medium green. A magical child's-eye thermal perception
      of the world where love literally glows hot. Grainy texture like
      a real thermal camera but artistically enhanced. Beautiful and strange.
    negative: "normal colors, photorealistic, boring, flat, simple"

  - id: "test-emotional-surge"
    mode: "emotional_surge"
    prompt: >
      Emotionally overwhelming manga-watercolor illustration. A father
      lifting his young son onto his shoulders on an Irish country road.
      BURST of golden light from behind them. Paint splatters and
      brushstrokes exploding from edges of frame. Manga-style impact
      lines radiating outward. Colors pushed to maximum - golden yellows,
      warm oranges, bright greens. Lens flare. The boy's green headphones
      catch the light. Everything glows from within. Visible paper texture
      breaking through. The emotion is too big for the frame. Pure joy.
    negative: "calm, muted, desaturated, simple, boring, photorealistic, dark"

  - id: "test-memory-wash"
    mode: "memory"
    prompt: >
      Nostalgic watercolor memory of a father and son walking on an Irish
      country road. Overexposed highlights, sun-bleached colors. Soft
      dissolved edges where the image fades into white paper. Heavy film
      grain. Faded warm palette - creams, soft golds, gentle greens.
      Slight vignette darkening the corners. The figures are slightly
      ghostly, translucent at edges. Like a cherished photograph left
      in sunlight for years. Beautiful but fragile. The boy's green
      headphones are the most vivid element remaining.
    negative: "sharp, high contrast, saturated, modern, digital, dark"

  - id: "test-rotoscope"
    mode: "rotoscope"
    prompt: >
      Rotoscoped illustration from life. Near-photorealistic father and
      young son walking on an Irish country road, but with visible paint
      technique overlay - brushstrokes following contours of faces,
      subtle color shifts in skin tones, slightly impressionistic
      background treatment. The boy wears bright green headphones.
      Documentary quality crossed with fine art. Raw, honest, real.
      Like watching actual footage through painted glass. Natural
      lighting, natural proportions, natural emotion.
    negative: "cartoon, anime, flat, over-stylized, exaggerated features, dark"

signature_elements:
  green_headphones:
    description: >
      Nick's bright green headphones are ALWAYS present and ALWAYS retain
      their green color, even when the rest of the image desaturates.
      They are the visual throughline of the entire series. When Nick
      and James are separated, the headphones are what connects them
      across episodes. In the darkest moments, that green is the only
      color that survives.
    color: "#6BBF59"
    rule: "NEVER desaturate. NEVER remove. ALWAYS visible."

  light_thread:
    description: >
      In every single frame, no matter how dark the story gets, there
      is always a thread of warm light. A crack under a door. A distant
      sunrise. A lamp left on. A phone screen glowing. James never
      gave up, and the visual language reflects that.
    rule: "Even in Mode 5 (The Dark), warm light is always present somewhere."

  paint_at_the_edges:
    description: >
      In emotional moments, the illustration's edges break down. Paint
      splatters, watercolor bleeds, brush marks visible at the margins
      of the frame. Like the emotion is too much for the art to contain.
      This intensifies through the series - by the reunion episodes,
      the paint practically explodes.
    rule: "Intensity of edge breakdown matches emotional intensity."
