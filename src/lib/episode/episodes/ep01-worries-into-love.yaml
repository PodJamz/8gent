      description: >
        Early morning. Irish light filtering through curtains. Nick's bedroom -
        toys scattered, drawings on the wall. Dad gently wakes him up.
        Nick stirs, reaches for his green headphones on the nightstand.
        Puts them on before he even opens his eyes properly. Dad smiles.
      visual_notes: >
        Warm golden morning light. Cozy bedroom with character - dinosaur
        duvet, drawings taped to wall, toy tiger on the floor. Close-up on
        green headphones being put on. Dad's silhouette in doorway.

      emotion: "playful"
      description: >
        In the car together. Nick in the back with headphones on, bopping
        to the music, pointing at things out the window. Irish countryside
        passing by - green fields, stone walls, grey sky but they don't care.
        Dad glancing in the rearview mirror, grinning at his son's joy.
        They arrive at school. Nick hops out. Quick hug. "Have a good day."
      visual_notes: >
        Match the reference image of them in the car. Green headphones,
        Nick pointing excitedly. Irish landscape through windows - very green,
        wet roads, maybe a rainbow. School gate arrival. Other kids in
        uniform. Nick's backpack bouncing as he runs in.
      sync_opportunities:
        - "'Nothing's working out' - Nick's feet hit the ground running into school"

      description: >
        Quick montage of Dad's day while Nick's at school. Working on music
        (laptop, headphones, studio vibes). Working on OpenClaw-OS maybe.
        Checking the clock. Making Nick's lunch for when he gets home.
        The energy of the chorus carries the montage - "It's up to you,
        it's up to me." Dad building their life.
      visual_notes: >
        Split into quick cuts synced to the beat. Laptop screen glowing.
        Headphones on (Dad's are dark/black, contrast with Nick's green).
        Clock on the wall. Sandwich being made with care. Each cut lands
        on a beat. The "It's up to you" line should show Dad looking at
        a photo of Nick on his desk/phone.
      sync_opportunities:
        - "Every 'up to you' / 'up to me' = new quick cut"
        - "'Feelings into love' = photo of Nick, soft moment"

      description: >
        After school. The park. Nick running ahead on a trail, arms out
        like an airplane. Dad following, hands in hoodie pockets. Irish
        nature around them - tall trees, ferns, maybe a stream. Nick
        crouches to look at something - a bug, a frog, a weird mushroom.
        Dad crouches next to him. They're in their own world.
        "There's no time like the present / A chance to see that here is heaven."
        This IS heaven. They just don't know it's about to be taken.
      visual_notes: >
        Match the forest reference image. Lush greens. Dad in blue hoodie.
        Nick with green headphones around his neck now (not on ears - he's
        exploring). Dappled sunlight. Maybe the little green creature from
        the reference image peeking from behind a tree. Piggyback ride.
      sync_opportunities:
        - "'No time like the present' = Nick leaps over a puddle"
        - "'Here is heaven' = wide shot of the two of them in the forest, golden light"

      emotion: "tender"
      description: >
        This is the heart of the episode. Quick, warm cuts of Nick being
        a good kid. Gesturing "please" at dinner. Smiling gratefully at a
        shopkeeper. Holding a door for someone. Sharing a snack with a
        friend at school. Dad gently reminding, Nick responding in his own
        way - through gestures, looks, and little acts of kindness.
        Dad watching with quiet pride.
        "Don't forget to say please and thank you."
        These are the values Dad taught him. The small things that make
        a good person. The things that matter.
      visual_notes: >
        Each "please and thank you" repetition = one small moment.
        Close-ups on Nick's face, sincere and sweet. Different locations
        for each one - dinner table, shop, school, park. Dad in the
        background of each, beaming. Warm, golden tones throughout.
        Nick communicates through gestures and expressions, not words.
        This section should feel like a photo album of good memories.
      sync_opportunities:
        - "Each 'please' = new cut to a new moment"
        - "Each 'and thank you' = Nick's reaction/smile"

        Evening. The couch. Match the reference image exactly. Nick on
        Dad's lap with the tablet, both looking at it together. Laptop
        open nearby. Toys scattered. The room is their kingdom.
        Headphones back on Nick. He's swaying to music.
        "It's up to you, it's up to me" - in this moment, it's just them.
        Their little universe. Complete.
      visual_notes: >
        Directly reference the couch illustration. Night sky through
        window, rocket ship drawing on wall, stuffed tiger, alphabet
        blocks. Warm lamp light. Nick nestled into Dad. Both faces lit
        by the tablet screen. Comfortable, lived-in, loved.

        - "'It's up to you' = Dad looks down at Nick"

      description: >
        Bedtime. Dad tucking Nick in. Green headphones placed on the
        nightstand. Nick's eyes closing. Dad lingering at the door,
        looking back. "Don't forget to say please and thank you" echoing
        softly. The light from the hallway catches Dad's face - a
        moment of something. Not worry exactly. Just... a father
        looking at his sleeping son, not knowing these ordinary nights
        are numbered.
        Fade to black. The song fades.
      visual_notes: >
        Quiet, dim. Nick asleep, peaceful face. Green headphones on
        nightstand catch a glint of hallway light. Dad's silhouette
        in the doorway. Last frame: the door slowly closing, a sliver
        of light narrowing.
        The bittersweet is for the AUDIENCE. Dad doesn't know yet.
        He just sees his beautiful sleeping boy. That's what makes it hit.

        - "'Don't forget to say please' = headphones placed down"

      placement: "Over the intro, before verse 1"
      voice: "Male, natural, quiet"
      notes: "Brief. Sets the time and place. The audience should feel the weight of 'before everything changed' without it being heavy-handed."

      placement: "Over the outro, as the door closes"

      notes: "Optional. Might be more powerful without it. Let the image and music carry it. Discuss with the owner."

  emotional_arc:
    # The audience knows the story. The creator and Nick don't (in the episode).
    # The tension is dramatic irony - everything is beautiful precisely
    # because we know it's about to be shattered.
    intro: "warmth, morning calm"
    verse1: "playful routine, school run energy"
    chorus1: "dad's purpose, building their life"
    verse2: "adventure, freedom, 'this is heaven'"
    bridge: "innocence, values, the small things"
    chorus3: "togetherness, completeness, their world"
    outro: "bittersweet, lingering, a door closing"

  series_notes: >
    This episode establishes the baseline of happiness. Everything that
    follows in the series - the Brazil trip, the betrayal, the 278 days
    fighting, the reunion - will be measured against this episode.
    This is what was at stake. This is what was worth fighting for.
    An ordinary Tuesday with your kid.
