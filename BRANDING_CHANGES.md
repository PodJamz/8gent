## Result

The OS now presents as **OpenClaw-OS** - a generic, professional operating system that users can make their own, rather than "James's personal OS" with his face everywhere.

The branding is clean, professional, and focused on the OpenClaw identity while still properly crediting you as the creator in the appropriate places (inspirations page, documentation).
