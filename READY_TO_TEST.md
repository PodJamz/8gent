## 🎙️ Next Steps for Voice

The plan is documented in `AI_JAMES_VOICE_PLAN.md`:

### Voice Snippets to Record:
1. **Welcome** - "Hey there! I'm AI James..."
2. **Name** - "What should I call you?"
3. **Aesthetic** - "Choose your theme. Upload your own or pick a preset."
4. **Intent** - "What brings you here today?"
5. **Personalization** - "Let's personalize with some images..."
6. **Completion** - "Your OS is ready. Welcome home."

### Implementation Ready:
- Audio player component structure planned
- Screen integration points identified
- Auto-play and sync logic designed

---

## 🎨 The Magic is Preserved

All the smooth morphing transitions from your original AI James OS are intact:
- `AnimatePresence mode="wait"`
- `opacity` transitions with `duration: 0.55`
- Gentle spring animations
- Staggered element appearances
- Skip buttons in the same style

The new aesthetic screen matches this perfectly:
- Clean white background (like other screens)
- Smooth fade in/out
- Auto-advance on selection
- Skip button at bottom
